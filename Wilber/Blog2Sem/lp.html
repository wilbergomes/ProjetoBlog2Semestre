      <h1>Numb</h1> 

      <p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be</p>
      <p>Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface</p>
      <p>I don't know what you're expecting of me</p> 
      <p>Put under the pressure</p> 
      <p>Of walking in your shoes</p>
      <p>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>
      <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</p>
      <p>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>

      <br />

      <p>I've become so numb</p>  
      <p>I can't feel you there</p> 
      <p>Become so tired</p>
      <p>So much more aware </p>
      <p>I'm becoming this</p>
      <p>All I want to do</p>
      <p>Is be more like me</p>
      <p>And be less like you</p>
      
      <br />  
      
      <p>Can't you see that you're smothering me</p> 
      <p>Holding too tightly</p> 
      <p>Afraid to lose control</p>
      <p>Cause everything that you thought I would be</p>
      <p>Has fallen apart right in front of you</p>
      <p>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>
      <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</p>
      <p>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>
      <p>And every second I waste is more than I can take</p>
     
      <br />

     <p>I've become so numb</p>  
      <p>I can't feel you there</p> 
      <p>Become so tired</p>
      <p>So much more aware </p>
      <p>I'm becoming this</p>
      <p>All I want to do</p>
      <p>Is be more like me</p>
      <p>And be less like you</p>
      
      <br />  

      <p>And I know</p>
      <p>I may end up failing too</p>
      <p>But I know</p> 
      <p>You were just like me /p> 
      <p>Não quer guerra com ninguém</p>
      <p>With someone disappointed in you</p>

      <br />

      <p> I've become so numb</p>

        <h1>A Place for my Head</h1>

        <p>I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night</p>
        <p>Shining with the light from the sun</p>
        <p>The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming</p>
        <p>The moon's going to owe it one</p>
        <p>It makes me think of how you act to me you do</p>
        <p>Favors and then rapidly you just</p>
        <p>Turn around and start asking me about</p>
        <p>Things that you want back from me</p>
        <p>I'm sick of the tension</p>
        <p>Sick of the hunger</p>
        <p>Sick of you acting like I owe you this</p>
        <p>Find another place to feed your greed</p>
        <p>While I find a place to rest</p>

        <br />

        <p>I wanna be in another place</p>
        <p>I hate when you say you don't understand</p>
        <p>I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy</p>
        <p>A place for my head</p>

        <br />

        <p> Maybe someday I'll be just like you and</p>
        <p> Step on people like you do</p>
        <p>And run away all the people I thought I knew</>
        <p> I remember back then who you were</p>
        <p> You used to be calm used to be strong</p>
        <p>Used to be generous but you should've known that you'd</p>
        <p>Wear out your welcome now you see</p>
        <p> How quiet it is all alone I'm so</p>
        <p>Sick of the tension sick of the hunger</p>
        <p>Sick of you acting like I owe you this</p>
        <p>Find another place to feed your greed</p>
        <p>While I find a place to rest I'm so</p>
        <p> Sick of the tension sick of the hunger</p>
        <p>Sick of you acting like I owe you this</p>
        <p>Find another place to feed your greed</p>
        <p>While I find a place to rest</p>

        <br />

        <p>I wanna be in another place</p>
        <p>I hate when you say you don't understand</p>
        <p>I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy</p>
        <p>A place for my head</p>


        <br />

       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
        
        <br />

       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
       <p>You try to take the best of me, Go away</p>
        
        <br />

       <p>I wanna be in another place</p>
       <p>I hate when you say you don't understand</p>
       <p>I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy</p>
       <p>A place for my head</p>
